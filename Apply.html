        <h2>GROWTH</h2>
        <p> Code-quettes aim to provide an environment where girls can learn together and grow together. We, as Buds and Bud-ees, not only have mentors guide their mentees, but also have the mentors learn from our mentees. We want to be able to have both our Buds and Bud-ees grow and pursue CS with confidence!

        <h2>ACTIVISM</h2>
        <p>Code-quette is a safe space for females who want to pursue computer science and want to be surrounded with a supportive and welcoming environment in a male-dominated field. We love our buds and we want to help them while breaking stereotypes one step at at a time!</p>
